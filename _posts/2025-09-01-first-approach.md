First GDD draft, and some level ideas:
* Tutorial : Simple objects with no textures, something like Portal, the aim is to explain basic functionality.
* Kitchen level: Maybe add priority queues in this level, you have to apply FIFO algorithm to serve clients.
* Factory: Multiple queues with different prioritys?
* Some level related to package redirection, like a communication tower.
Maybe add one queue for each kind of plate in the restaurant level? This way, for example, appetizers would have priority over main courses.

Idea: Resource manager city builder, how you applied the algorithms determines the earnings of each business. With the currency, you unlock new areas, buildings and algorithms.
