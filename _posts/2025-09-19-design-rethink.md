After some feedback, another reading of the accessibility guidelines, and playing other games for inspiration, we decided to change the game design almost completely. Here are some reflections:

Rethink about the game:
* Restart level -> Reset buttons -> Levers (Improve visibility)
* Remove accept button (It's redundant)
* Is the player going to be standing or seated?
* Instead of sorting objects, maybe we can make players build an object by using the components in the right order
* Add queues to facilitate deducing next steps
* Maybe you can be hovering on top of the street, seeing how buildings get rebuilt?
* Instead of building an object, build the buildings themselves
* Use a surprise event to add emergency and give reasons to use other algorithms
* Maybe the user builds a model and then the workers build the real building?
