After a first look at the guidelines, maybe we want to make layouts consistent throughout every level. We also want to minimize the rotation and movement for the user to reach different elements of the game, for better accessibility.

Some other decisions that are backed by the accessibility guidelines are:
* Items ressemble real world items and their functioning.
* Less realistic avatar for a younger audience.

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/posts/03-09_4.png" alt="" class="full">

Diegetic interfaces! (This wasn't as important before reading the guidelines). The designs above are discarded.
