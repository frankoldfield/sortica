Redacted the first draft of the learning objectives:
1. **LO1:** After playing the game, the learner will be able to explain and apply the concept of [Scheduling Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheduling_(computing)).
2. **LO2:** After playing the game, the learner will be able to explain and apply the concept of [Queue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queue_(abstract_data_type)).
3. **LO3:** After playing the game, the learner will be able to explain and apply the concept of [Stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type)).
4. **LO4:** After playing the game, the learner will be able to explain and apply the concept of [Multi-Level Queue (MLQ)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilevel_queue).
5. **LO5:** After playing the game, the learner will be able to explain and apply the concept of [Priority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priority_queue).
6. **LO6:** After playing the game, the learner will be able to explain and apply [First-in-First-Out (FIFO) algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFO_(computing_and_electronics)).
7. **LO7:** After playing the game, the learner will be able to explain and apply [Last-in-First-Out (LIFO) algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type)#Implementations).
8. **LO8:** After playing the game, the learner will be able to explain and apply [FIFO algorithms involving multiple queues with different priorities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilevel_queue).
9. **LO9:** After playing the game, the learner will be able to explain and apply [Round-Robin algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-robin_scheduling).
10. **LO10:** While playing the game, the learner will be able to demonstrate problem-solving skills using interactive, hands-on gameplay mechanics.
11. **LO11:** While playing the game, the learner will engage with accessibility features that support diverse visual, auditory, and motor needs while completing in-game tasks.
