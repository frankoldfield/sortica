Finished the fully functional prototype with two levels, after user testing with 3 individuals, we got some more feedback:
* More introduction / boarding.
* Bigger computer screen.
* More time to read / being able to read for as long as you want.
* Nervous individual: something to draw attention and retain focus, maybe verbal instructions and sound.
