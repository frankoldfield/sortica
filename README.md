# Algorithmic Inventory Sorter
The proposed serious game, titled "Algorithmic Inventory Sorter," places the user in a virtual workshop where they are tasked with managing items arriving on a conveyor belt. The core mechanic involves interacting with a virtual machine to process these items according to specific rules that mirror the logic of fundamental data structures. For example, one puzzle requires a Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) approach, demonstrating the behavior of a Stack, while another requires a First-In, First-Out (FIFO) approach, demonstrating a Queue. Through this hands-on, puzzle-based interaction, the game aims to make abstract computer science concepts tangible and understandable for learners in an immersive environment.

The expectation is to develop a functional proof of concept serious game prototype with functionalities sufficient to run the study, rather than a fully-fledged serious game.
